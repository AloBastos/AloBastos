👋 Hi there! I'm Aloisio Bastos (AloBastos)
I work with agile products and digital product management, and I'm now expanding my journey into the world of programming. With a background in mechanical engineering and the automotive industry — including technical procurement, transportation, and body development — I bring a strong foundation in solving complex problems and delivering value-driven solutions.

💡 I'm passionate about connecting technology, product, and education.
📚 Author of eBooks like "Scrum Essencial" and "Desvendando o Invisível", where I explain technical topics — such as embedded systems and IoT — in a clear and approachable way.
🛠️ On this GitHub, you'll find personal projects, code experiments, educational content, and simple tools I’ve built to solve real-world problems.
